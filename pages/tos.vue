        <h4>5.3 Other Content</h4>
        <p>
          Content that is not covered by the licenses set forth in Sections 5.1 or 5.2 shall be governed by this Section 5.3 (e.g., text you submit in chat).
          You grant Hark a perpetual and irrevocable right and license to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and display such content through online means in connection with our Services.
